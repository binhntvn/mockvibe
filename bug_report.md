## 3. Detailed Bug Reports

### BUG-001: Incorrect Supabase Credentials
- **Description**: The application was not displaying products because the Supabase client was initialized with hardcoded, incorrect credentials.
- **Resolution**: The `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` file was updated to use the correct credentials from the `.env` file.

### BUG-002: User Registration Failure
- **Description**: The registration form was showing an "Invalid email address" error, which was misleading. The root cause was likely a password that did not meet the Supabase project's strength requirements.
- **Resolution**: The registration form's error handling was improved to provide a clearer message to the user. The user was also advised to disable the email confirmation requirement in the Supabase dashboard.

### BUG-003: Login Failure for Existing User
- **Description**: An existing user could not log in due to an "Email not confirmed" error, even after email verification was disabled.
- **Resolution**: The user's email was manually confirmed in the database using an admin SQL query.

### BUG-004: Empty Cart on Checkout
- **Description**: The user's shopping cart was empty on the checkout page, making it impossible to place an order. This was due to the React Context being re-initialized on page navigation.
- **Resolution**: The `CartContext` was refactored to persist the cart state to `localStorage`, ensuring it is retained across page loads.

### BUG-005: 404 Error on Deployed Site
- **Description**: Navigating directly to routes other than the home page on the Vercel deployment resulted in a 404 error.
- **Resolution**: A `vercel.json` file was created with rewrite rules to redirect all traffic to `index.html`, allowing the client-side router to handle the routes.

### BUG-006: Backend Connection Error
- **Description**: The FastAPI backend was unable to connect to the database, resulting in a `getaddrinfo failed` error.
- **Resolution**: The database connection string in the `backend/.env` file was updated to use the session pooler connection string from Supabase.

### BUG-007: Missing Backend Dependency
- **Description**: The backend crashed when handling form data because the `python-multipart` library was missing.
- **Resolution**: The `python-multipart` library was added to the `backend/requirements.txt` file and installed.

### BUG-008: Database Type Mismatch (UUID)
- **Description**: Multiple API endpoints were failing with a `ResponseValidationError` because the SQLAlchemy models were returning `UUID` objects while the Pydantic schemas expected strings.
- **Resolution**: A custom Pydantic `BaseModel` was created with a `json_encoder` to automatically convert `UUID` objects to strings during serialization. All schemas were updated to inherit from this custom model.
